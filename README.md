### Chen Sun, Wannan Yang, Benjamin Alsbury-Nealy, Yoshua Bengio, Blake Richards 2022

This repository implements contrastive introspection (ConSpec) as detailed in the paper: 

The Multikeytodoor subfolder implements ConSpec with a PPO backbone in multi-door-to-key tasks. 

The 3DOrangeTree subfolder implements ConSpec in the OrangeTree task described in the paper.

The conspecfunction subfolder implements ConSpec as a compact function that can be added onto any RL agent of choice and trained, for interested researchers.
