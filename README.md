This repository implements contrastive Retrospection (ConSpec) as detailed in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05845.pdf

The Multikeytodoor subfolder implements ConSpec with a PPO backbone in multi-door-to-key tasks. 

The 3DOrangeTree subfolder implements ConSpec in the OrangeTree task described in the paper.

The conspecfunction subfolder implements ConSpec as a self-contained function that can be added onto any RL agent of choice and trained, for interested researchers.
