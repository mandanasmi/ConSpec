This repository implements Contrastive Retrospection (ConSpec) as detailed in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05845.pdf

The conspecfunction subfolder implements ConSpec as a self-contained Class that can be added onto any RL agent of choice and trained autonomously. It has documentation, and should be easy to use for interested researchers.** It also contains a working example of ConSpec helping train a 4-key gridworld task as seen in the paper from fig. 4. **

The 3DOrangeTree subfolder implements ConSpec in the OrangeTree task described in the paper but **is a much older repository** - will clean up at a later date.
